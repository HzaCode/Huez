# Summary

Huez is a Python library that provides a single-call, cross-backend theming layer for mainstream plotting libraries. It harmonizes visual elements like color, typography, and layout to ensure consistency across figures generated by different tools, and includes optional accessibility linting.

# Statement of Need

To the best of our knowledge, within the Python visualization ecosystem, no published tool provides a single-call, cross-backend theming layer that harmonizes discrete and continuous color scales, category-to-color mappings, typography, and baseline layout across mainstream plotting libraries, while also offering optional accessibility linting with empirically evaluated cross-backend consistency guarantees.
